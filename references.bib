abstract = {The main idea in the original Grover search (1997 Phys. Rev. Lett. 79 325) is to single out a target state containing the solution to a search problem by amplifying the amplitude of the state, following the Oracle's job, i.e., a black box giving us information about the target state. We design quantum circuits to accomplish a complete Grover search involving both the Oracle's job and the amplification of the target state, which are employed to solve satisfiability (SAT) problems. We explore how to carry out the quantum circuits with currently available ion-trap quantum computing technology.}

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

Then we present a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) formulation, which is suitable for the adiabatic quantum computation for a D-Wave architecture. Further, we derive a physical Hamiltonian from the QUBO formulation and discuss its adequateness in the adiabatic framework. Finally, we discuss the complexity of running the Hamiltonian cycle QUBO on a D-Wave quantum computer, and compare it with existing quantum computational methods.},
